####we need a function to sort our data in the json file

text = open('data.txt','r')

web_pages = text.read()


## we need to sort by hierarchy of pages 
##we can do this by amount of parenthesis in the url

##step 1 remove "checked" 



##step 2 sort by amount of /  in the url which will give us hierachical order
##this will give us nodes of our graph
